## About
[EcoPro](https://nasa-ecopro.org/) is a NASA-funded project to build ecological projection models to better understand how climate change will effect ecosystems. This study specifically looks at understanding the relationship between climate change and Sierra Nevada tree mortality.

## Setup
It is recommended to use the `environment.yml` file for creating an environment with `conda` for running the code.
